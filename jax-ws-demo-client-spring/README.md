Preparing the JAX-WS Client Using Spring
========================================

Description
-----------

This project provides a client application for the previous jax-ws-demo-war 
example. It uses the default JAX-WS implemention included in the Oracle JDK.
The main point, however, is to initialize the client using Spring Framework.

If necessary, you can change the URL to which the client connects inside
`src/main/resources/fi/codecenter/examples/client/applicationContext.xml`.

Running the Sample
------------------

Run `fi.codecenter.examples.client.HelloServiceClient` inside Eclipse.
